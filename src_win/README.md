# Environment
This base project requires:
 * At least version 8.0 of the CUDA toolkit available [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
 * An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is also required. You can find a list of CUDA compatible GPUs [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
 * For windows, install make_install/make-3.81.exe, then add its bin dir into PATH. After you can execute "cd src_win && make" to compile it.
 It has been tested in windows 10, CUDA 8.0 and CUDA 9.2.
